# Project Idea: "Code Quest: Logic Puzzle Adventure"
# A text-based logic puzzle adventure game made entirely using conditionals, loops, and functions.

# Itâ€™s like a "choose-your-path" story mixed with brain teasers and coding challenges â€” all in the terminal, all logic-based.

# Players (your students) move through stages of a fictional world.
# At each stage, they must solve puzzles using logic, math, or reasoning, implemented as Python functions.

# Expected output:

# ðŸ§­ Welcome, Adventurer!

# You're trapped in a logic dungeon.
# Solve puzzles to unlock the next gate!

# Level 1: The Number Gate
# > Enter a number divisible by 3 and 5 but not 10:

# Level 2: The Code Wall
# > Crack the passcode: it's the reverse of '3142', doubled.

# Level 3: The Word Riddle
# > Find the word with 3 vowels and ends with 'ing':

# Level 4: The Loop Maze
# > Reach 100 by adding only even numbers from 1â€“20. How many steps?
